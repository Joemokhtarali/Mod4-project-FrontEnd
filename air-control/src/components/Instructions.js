        <p>Our game illustrates the impact on the environment when trees get cut down and how that affects the atmosphere. The player has to make tough decisions to keep the balance of the air quality under control. The shifts in weather and temperature will play a huge part in their decisions. The player will succeed the game by keeping the carbon dioxide level lower or equal to the oxygen level and based on how many trees in the forest are still remaining.</p>
